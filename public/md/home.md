Welcome to **jpchars-web**

This website can be used to help you learn vocabulary, especially with languages with a different writing system like Japanese.

Currently Japanese is the only supported foreign language.

If you don't have any clue where to start, lookup a guide or tutorial for japanese online as this website is rather meant to help you learn and reinforce learned subjects.

Before you learn japanese you should get used to the writing system. Use the Hiragana/Katakana (Normal and Reverse) tabs on the left to learn those. If you have never looked at them before check the cheatsheet before learning.
